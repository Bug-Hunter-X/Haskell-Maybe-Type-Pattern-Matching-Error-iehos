The solution handles the `Nothing` case, preventing the runtime error.

```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x + 1
myFunction Nothing = 0 -- Handle the Nothing case

--Alternatively, using Maybe-aware functions:
myFunction' :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction' = maybe 0 (+1)
```
