This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming involving pattern matching on the Maybe type. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which fails to handle the `Nothing` case, leading to a runtime exception. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.hs`, corrects this by explicitly handling the `Nothing` case using a more robust pattern match or a Maybe-aware function.
